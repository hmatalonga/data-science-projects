# :ship: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

In this project I will explore different machine learning techniques to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

After doing some of [Kaggle micro courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview), this competition was recommended to get familiar with ML basics and to learn how Kaggle competions work.

This [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is a classic beginner project and it was one of the first projects, so I find it interesting to revisit this challenge from time to time and experiment new ideas, and hopefully improve my submission score :smile:
