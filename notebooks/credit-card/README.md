In this project, I will explore the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset and build a model to predict which transactions are legit and fraudulent. Since this dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. It is an excellent opportunity to try out different techniques to deal with imbalanced classification cases.

This dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

I have written a blog post about this project. You can read it here:
