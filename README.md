# Data Science Projects

This is a collection of Data Science projects for learning and exploration purposes. The projects are organized and grouped by subject/topic covering different approaches, algorithms and data-sets. Each project consists of a *Jupyter notebook* and it has its own folder under the `notebooks/` folder.

> :warning: This repository contains code and models experiments and are not production ready, reusable, optimised and fine-tuned code and models. This is rather a sandbox or a playground for learning and trying different data science, machine learning techniques and approaches. Models might not perform well and there is a place for overfitting/underfitting.

**Acknowledgements:** This repository was originally inspired by [:robot: Interactive Machine Learning Experiments](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments).

## Projects

Projects were built using a combination of different libraries and tools and the most used were [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) and [Tensorflow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/) with [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview) API. The dependencies for each project is included in a `requirements.txt` file. For projects where the data-sets were auto-generated or scraped a `data` folder is present.
